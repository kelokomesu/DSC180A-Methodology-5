**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The paper surrounding the PAIR implementation was the most interesting so far. I was surprised at how simple it was to implement but there is a lot of work that can be done to improve specific aspects of the model.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I could see us investigating PAIR implementations with more LLM's and comparing the baselines to other models. Or I could see us moving to the defense side of LLM jailbreaking and try to discover better ways of defending LLM's. We have researched smoothLLM defenses but none of them have been as sufficient as I am sure they hoped to be. There is also room to investigate the metrics by which we analyze jailbreaking methods and defenses, as there is currently no way to really say, "this model is sufficiently defended", or something along that sentiment.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Maybe we could have investigated more into other approaches to jailbreaking LLMs, but since PAIR does seem to be the best it makes sense to persue this method given the amount of time. 


**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Something which could help analyze the output jailbreaks of our models, such as NLP to do sentiment analysis maybe.
